logcheck (1.4.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Beginning with bookworm, logcheck defaults to checking the systemd
  journal in addition to any syslog files created by rsyslog or other
  similar daemons. If you wish to disable either the journal or syslog
  source, please modify the corresponding configuration file under
  /etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles.d/.

logcheck (1.2.19-2) unstable; urgency=low

  As of version 1.2.19, logcheck no longer runs as root.
  Logcheck runs as user logcheck which has been created
  and added to group adm upon configuration.

  If you have customized your configuration,
  you will need to be sure that your
  logs are readable by the logcheck user.

logcheck (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  Changes to ignore.d directory behaviour
  Now the ignore.d directories function in an additive manner (i.e. higher
  levels also include the lower levels):
  - workstation  = workstation + server + paranoid
  - server       = server + paranoid
  - paranoid     = paranoid

  Also run-parts(8) now controls which rulefiles are included from the .d
  directories. Please see /usr/share/doc/logcheck for more details.
