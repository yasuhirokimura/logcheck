Suggests: syslog-summary
Description: mails anomalies in the system logfiles to the administrator
 Logcheck helps spot problems and security violations in your logfiles
 automatically and will send the results to you in e-mail.

 Logcheck was part of the Abacus Project of security tools, but this
 version has been rewritten.

Package: logcheck-database
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: database of system log rules for the use of log checkers
 This database is part of the Logcheck package, but might be used by others.
 It brings a database of regular expressions for matching system log entries
 after various criteria.

Package: logtail
Architecture: all
Depends: perl (>= 5.8.0),
         ${misc:Depends}
Description: Print log file lines that have not been read
 This program will read in a standard text file and create an
 offset marker when it reads the end. The offset marker is read
 the next time logtail is run and the text file pointer is moved
 to the offset location. This allows logtail to read in the next
 lines of data following the marker. This is good for marking log
 files for automatic log file checkers to monitor system events.
 .
 The package also provides logtail2, which better deals with rotated log
 files: If logtail2 finds that the inode of the file was changed, it assumes
 that the log has been rotated, and tries to find the file it was rotated to
 using heuristic plugins. If it finds the file, it will print the remainder of
 the file starting at the offset saved to the offset file. If a file with the
 correct inode was not found, logtail2 will only print the new file in its
 entirety before writing a new offset file.
