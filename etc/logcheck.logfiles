## Logs that will be checked by logcheck
#
# This file is empty and all settings are in files (whose name must
# end in '.logfiles') under /etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles.d/
#
# It is recommended that you put local settings into
# /etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles.d/local.logfiles instead of editing this file
#
# Each line should be:
# - an absolute path to a log
# - the word 'journal' which will check lines in the systemd journal
#
# Comments, starting with '#', and blank lines are ignored
